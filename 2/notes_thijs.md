# Notes for chaper 2

Combinatie van tekstfragmenten van het boek en eigen samenvattingen.  

- An _agent_ is anything that can be viewed as perceiving it's _environment_ through _sensors_ and acting upon that environment through _actuators_.
- _rational agent_: an agent that does the right and optimal thing, based on a _performance measure_
  - Definition of a _rational agent_: For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.
- _omniscience agent_: An omniscient agent knows the actual outcome of its actions and can act accordingly; but omniscience is impossible in reality.
- _simple reflex agent_: Act solely upon the current perception based on an condition-action-rule.
- _model-based reflex agent_: Agent with internal state, makes a model of the world based on the perceived part of the environment.
- _goal-based agent_: act to achieve their goals
- _utility-based agents_ try to maximize their own expected "happiness"
- _percept_: the agent's perceptual inputs at any given instant.
- _percept sequence_: the complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived.
- De door de agent gekozen actie kan alleen gebaseerd worden op de huidige percept Ã³f op de (of een deel van) percept sequence. De agent kan geen acties baseren op dingen die de agent nog niet heeft perceived.
- _agent function_: maps any given percept sequence to an action, abstract mathematical description, possibly unachievable in real world scenarios.
- _agent program_: concrete implementation of the agent function, the task of the AI expert/student
- _Task environment_ is beschreven door _PEAS_: Performance measure, environment, actuators, sensors: zie `./2/Notes.ipynb`. In designing an agent, the first step must always be to specify the task environment as fully as possible.
- _competitive multiagent environment_: environment waarbij agents hun eigen belang nagaan.
- _cooperative multiagent environment_: to maximise the performance measure of all agents.
- De moeilijkste environment is een combinatie van: partially observable, multiagent, stochastic, sequential, dynamic, continous en unknown: zie `./2/Notes.ipynb`.
