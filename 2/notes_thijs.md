# Notes for chaper 1

- An _agent_ is anything that can be viewed as perceiving it's _environment_ through _sensors_ and acting upon that environment through _actuators_.
- _rational agent_: an agent that does the right and optimal thing, based on a _performance measure_
  - Definition of a _rational agent_: For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.
- _omniscience agent_: An omniscient agent knows the actual outcome of its actions and can act accordingly; but omniscience is impossible in reality.
- _percept_: the agent's perceptual inputs at any given instant.
- _percept sequence_: the complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived.
- De door de agent gekozen actie kan alleen gebaseerd worden op de huidige percept Ã³f op de (of een deel van) percept sequence. De agent kan geen acties baseren op dingen die de agent nog niet heeft perceived.
- _agent function_: maps any given percept sequence to an action, abstract mathematical description, possibly unachievable in real world scenarios.
- _agent program_: concrete implementation of the agent function
- _PEAS_: Performance measure, environment, actuators, sensors: zie `./2/Notes.ipynb`
