    "## 2.1\n",
    "An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentâ€™s behaviour is described by the agent function that maps any given percept sequence to an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Percept sequence\n",
    "    - The complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2\n",
    "A **rational agent** is an agent that does the right thing (every entry in the table for the agent function is filled out correctly).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **performance measure** is the notion of desirability that evaluates any given sequence of environment states (environment states, because an agent can delude himself).  \n",
    "*It is better to design performance measures according to what one actually wants in the environment, rather than according to how one thinks the agent should behave.*  \n",
    "  \n",
    "An agent lacks autonomy when it relies on the prior knowledge of its designer rather than on its own percepts. The incorporation of learning allows one to design a single rational agent that will succeed in a vast variety of environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3\n",
    "The first step in designing an agent is specifying the task environment (the \"problem\" to which rational agents are the \"solution\".  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### PEAS\n",
    "- **P** -> Performance measure (tradeoffs are required when goals conflict)\n",
    "- **E** -> Environment\n",
    "- **A** -> Actuators (the means of control of the agent)\n",
    "- **S** -> Sensors (for the perception of the environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore the task environment can have some properties (dimensions)  \n",
    "- Fully observable vs Partially observable\n",
    "    - A task environment is effectively fully observable if the sensors detect all aspects that are relevant (depends on the performance measure) to the choice of action\n",
    "- Single agent vs multi-agent\n",
    "    - The distinction between single agent or multi-agent environments can be subtle. Because when is something another agent or just a behaving according to the laws of physics.\n",
    "- Deterministic vs stochastic\n",
    "    - A task environment is deterministic if the next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the action executed by the agent.\n",
    "    - An environment is called uncertain when it is not fully observable or not deterministic.\n",
    "    - **note**: The use of the word *stochastic* generally implies that uncertainty about outcomes is quantified in terms of probabilities; a nondeterministic environment is one in which actions are characterized by their possible outcomes, but no probabilities are attached to them.\n",
    "- Episodic vs Sequential\n",
    "    - In an episodic environment, the agent's experience is divided into episodes. In each episode the agent receives a percept and makes an action. The next episode does not depend on the actions taken in the previous episode!\n",
    "- Static vs dynamic\n",
    "    - If the environment can change while an agent is deliberating than we call the environment dynamic for that agent.\n",
    "- Discrete vs Continious\n",
    "    - The discrete/continious applies to the state of the environment, to the way time is handles and the way times is handles. For instance, with chess, there is a finite amount of distinct states and has a discrete set of actions and percepts.\n",
    "- Known vs unknown\n",
    "    - Refers to the agent's state of knowledge about the *law of physics* of the environment.\n",
    "    - It is possible for known environment to be partially observable (e.g. poker). The agent knows the rules but is still unable to see all the cards.\n",
