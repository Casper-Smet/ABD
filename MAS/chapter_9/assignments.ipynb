    "# Aggregating Preferences: Social Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example of the designer perspective is voting. How should a central authority pool the preferences of different agents so as to best reflect the wishes of the population as a whole? It turns out that voting, the kind familiar from our political and other institutions, is only a special case of the general class of _social choice problems_. Social choice is a motivational but nonstrategic theory—agents have preferences, but do not try to camouflage them in order to manipulate the outcome (of voting, for example) to ther personal advantage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An good example for social choice theory is plurality voting. Here we ask every voter to vote for his/her favorite choice after which the choice that received the largest number of votes is chosen. This is called the _plurality_ method. This method is quite standard but not without problems, because there is a need to select a tie-breaking rule (when two choices are equally favored).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Condorcet condition\n",
    "This condition states that if there exists a candidate $x$ such that for all other candidates $y$ at least half the voters prefer $x$ to $y$, then $x$ must be chosen.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with the following order in place:  \n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} a &\\succ b \\succ c \\\\ b &\\succ c \\succ a \\\\ c &\\succ b \\succ a \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "With the plurality method there would be a tie between all three candidates and so a tie breaker would be activated. However, the Condorcet condition would choose $b$, since two of the three candidates prefer $b$ to $a$ and likewise prefer $b$ to $c$.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "But the Condorcet isn't without problems. When the following order is in place:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} a &\\succ b \\succ c \\\\ b &\\succ c \\succ a \\\\ c &\\succ a \\succ b \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "The Condorcet condition does not tell what to do here, because there is no real preference displayed."
